# Super Mario Bros. 2 (Japan) MMC1 Port

A port of the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 to the MMC1 mapper, reconfiguring the game similarly to how an official FDS-to-NES conversion might have been handled.

## Download

There are patches for both NTSC and PAL conversions, and they can be retrieved from the links below:
- [NTSC BPS Patch](https://github.com/Simplistic-Memes/smb2j-mmc1/raw/ntsc/smb2j-mmc1.bps)
- [PAL BPS Patch](https://github.com/Simplistic-Memes/smb2j-mmc1/raw/pal/smb2j-mmc1.bps)

Apply the patch to a clean Super Mario Bros. 2 FDS ROM. The MD5 hash of the ROM needed is `7f38210a8a2befb8d347523b4ff6ae7c`.

You can use an BPS patcher such as https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ to apply the patch. You may need to change the file extension of the output file to ".nes" after patching.

The source code compiles with asm6, provided in the repo. If using Windows, the provided batch file can compile automatically.
